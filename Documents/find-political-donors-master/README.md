1. packages used in the script
from functools import reduce
import collections
from statistics import median
import sys

2.note:
all the packages can be replaced, but using these packages can save time.

3.test results
I can ran the test with correct output file selected by the transaction date.
As for the zip code selection, I can not fully understand the example, and I think we should delete the duplicate records 
and leave out a total of four records.

Thanks!
